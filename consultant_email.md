Subject: URGENT: Critical Review Pipeline Failure - Need Expert Consultation

Dear Consultant,

I'm reaching out because we have a critical technical issue that's preventing our core business functionality from working. Despite multiple attempts to fix it, we need expert guidance to resolve this properly.

## BUSINESS OVERVIEW

**Company:** Reviews & Marketing (formerly ReviewPilot)
**Website:** reviewsandmarketing.com
**Core Business:** SaaS platform that helps businesses collect customer reviews and manage their online reputation

**What We Do:**
- Provide businesses with short links (e.g., reviewsandmarketing.com/ChIJRygse5CCRo4Rg2P29c0HvZU) that customers can use to rate their experience
- Customers rate 1-5 stars:
  - 1-4 stars: Submit feedback directly to us (what would make it 5 stars?)
  - 5 stars: Redirect to Google Reviews to leave public review
- Business owners see all feedback and metrics on their dashboard
- Integrates with Square POS for automated review requests

## TECHNOLOGY STACK

**Backend:**
- Node.js/Express.js server
- Deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Firebase Admin SDK for Firestore database
- JWT-based authentication (custom implementation)

**Frontend:**
- EJS templating engine
- Vanilla JavaScript (no framework)
- CSS/SCSS styling

**Infrastructure:**
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EB)
- AWS Route 53 (DNS)
- AWS SES (email)
- AWS Cognito (user management)
- AWS KMS (encryption)
- AWS ElastiCache Redis (for BullMQ job queue)
- Firebase Firestore (primary database)
- Square API integration (OAuth 2.0)

**Key Services:**
- BullMQ for background job processing
- Twilio for SMS
- Postmark for transactional emails
- Stripe for payments

## THE CRITICAL PROBLEM

**Issue:** Customer reviews submitted via short links are NOT appearing on business owners' dashboards.

**Symptoms:**
1. Customer submits review (1-5 stars) via short link
2. Backend receives and saves review to Firestore `reviews` collection
3. Business owner's dashboard shows:
   - Zero reviews in "Customer Feedback" table
   - Zero metrics in "Insights" section (total feedback, average rating, etc.)
   - Empty data despite reviews being submitted

**What We've Tried:**
1. **Fixed review submission endpoint** - Reviews are being saved to Firestore
2. **Updated Firestore indexes** - Added composite index on `userId` (ASC) and `createdAt` (DESC)
3. **Implemented diagnostic endpoint** - `/api/admin/debug/pipeline` to analyze the pipeline
4. **Added comprehensive logging** - `[PIPELINE-WRITE]` and `[PIPELINE-READ]` operations
5. **Fixed userId attribution** - Ensuring reviews are properly linked to business owners
6. **Added real-time stats aggregation** - Updating business document stats on each review

**Current Status:**
- Reviews are being submitted and saved to Firestore
- Dashboard queries are failing to retrieve the reviews
- We suspect either:
  - Data attribution mismatch (wrong userId being used)
  - Firestore index issues
  - Query structure problems

## WHAT WE NEED TO ACHIEVE

**Immediate Goal:** Fix the review pipeline so business owners can see customer feedback on their dashboards.

**Long-term Goals:**
1. **Robust Review Collection:** Reliable end-to-end pipeline from customer submission to dashboard display
2. **Real-time Metrics:** Live updates of review counts, ratings, and insights
3. **Square Integration:** Automated review requests via Square POS
4. **Analytics Dashboard:** Comprehensive business intelligence from review data
5. **Email/SMS Automation:** Automated follow-up sequences for review collection

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DETAILS

**Database Structure:**
```
businesses/{uid} - Business owner documents
  - userId: string (Firebase Auth UID)
  - googlePlaceId: string
  - shortSlug: string
  - stats: object (totalFeedback, averageRating, etc.)

reviews/{reviewId} - Customer review documents
  - businessId: string (reference to business)
  - userId: string (business owner's UID)
  - rating: number (1-5)
  - comment: string (optional)
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - source: string ('shortlink')
```

**Key Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/reviews` - Submit customer review
- `GET /dashboard` - Business owner dashboard
- `GET /api/admin/debug/pipeline` - Diagnostic endpoint
- `/:slug` - Short link resolver

**Authentication Flow:**
- Custom JWT implementation
- Session management with Express
- Middleware: `requireLogin`, `requireAccess`

## CURRENT DEBUGGING EFFORTS

We've implemented extensive logging and diagnostics:

1. **Pipeline Write Logging:**
   ```
   [PIPELINE-WRITE] Incoming: businessId=xxx rating=3
   [PIPELINE-WRITE] SUCCESS id=yyy userId=zzz
   ```

2. **Pipeline Read Logging:**
   ```
   [PIPELINE-READ] Fetching data for loggedInUserId: xxx
   [PIPELINE-READ] SUCCESS: Found X reviews. Stats count: Y.
   ```

3. **Diagnostic Endpoint:**
   - `GET /api/admin/debug/pipeline` returns:
     - `attributionCheck`: Simple userId filter
     - `dashboardQuery`: Complex query with ordering
     - Any errors that occur

## SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FOR YOU

1. **What's the most likely cause** of reviews not appearing on dashboards?
2. **How should we debug** the data flow from submission to display?
3. **Are there common pitfalls** in Firestore queries that we might be hitting?
4. **Should we restructure** our data model or query approach?
5. **What monitoring/tools** should we implement to catch these issues earlier?

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS NEEDED

1. **Identify the root cause** of the pipeline failure
2. **Implement the fix** with proper testing
3. **Verify the solution** works end-to-end
4. **Add monitoring** to prevent future failures

## BUSINESS IMPACT

This is blocking our core value proposition. Without working review collection and display, we cannot:
- Demonstrate value to customers
- Generate revenue
- Build customer trust
- Scale the business

We need this resolved urgently to continue operations.
